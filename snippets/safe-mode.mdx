# Hint - Running in Safe Mode

If you're running into memory issues when running large function stacks or working with large data sets, you can run with Safe Mode by clicking the arrow next to the Run button and choosing **Safe Mode**.

Safe Mode runs the function stack without retaining any context in memory, which can be very helpful when looping over a significant amount of data and you're experiencing crashes. _No context_ just means that things like autocomplete won't work, and the output of debugging information will be limited.

Any questions, please reach out to our support team!
