# Why is the Marketplace not enabled by default?

We are in the process of phasing out this version of the Marketplace in favor of Xano Actions and related features. You can still use the Marketplace, and anything you utilize there will not disappear, but please note that some Marketplace extensions may not be up to date. We're working hard to bring you a better experience here.
