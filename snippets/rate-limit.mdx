title: rate limit
---

To keep Xano's free plan safe and fair for everyone sharing the resources of our free server instance, a rate limit of **10 requests every 20 seconds** is enforced.

When you encounter the rate limit, you'll see a message like this:

```
{"code":"ERROR_CODE_TOO_MANY_REQUESTS","message":"Whoa there! Your plan only supports 10 requests per 20 seconds. Upgrade options and additional information is available at: https://xano.gitbook.io/xano/instances/api-rate-limit"}
```

## What can I do when I hit the rate limit?

* Wait up to 20 seconds before sending a new request
* Upgrade to a [paid plan](https://www.xano.com/pricing).

{% hint style="info" %}
Rate limits **do not apply** when testing inside of Xano â€” you can use our [Run and Debug features](../../the-function-stack/building-with-visual-development/#testing-a-draft) to test as much as you'd like!
{% endhint %}
