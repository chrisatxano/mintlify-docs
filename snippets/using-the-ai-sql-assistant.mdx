{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## If the query returns the expected results, click <mark style="color:blue;">Update SQL</mark>. Otherwise, you can ask the assistant to make any desired modifications or fixes.

You can also make your own modifications to the query, such as adding ? characters to represent dynamic values.
