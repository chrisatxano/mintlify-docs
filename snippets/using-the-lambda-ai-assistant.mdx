title: Using the Lambda AI Assistant

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
## Give the assistant context by running your function stack first.

If you don't do this, you can still use the AI assistant, but it will make certain inferences that may not be correct.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Look for the ![](<../assets/CleanShot 2025-02-24 at 10.43.11.png>) button and click it to enable the assistant.


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Ask the assistant for help as needed.

In this example, we're asking the assistant to write a function that imports the Decamelize library and applies it to our 'test' input.

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../assets/CleanShot 2025-02-24 at 10.45.23.png" alt="" width="257"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
## Choose how to proceed with the assistant's suggestions.

You can click ![](<../assets/CleanShot 2025-02-24 at 10.46.22.png>) to add the suggestions to the Lambda function code, or you can copy it manually and place it as needed.

Be sure to **rate the assistant's suggestion(s)** using the :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown: buttons. We'll use this information to improve the behavior of the assistant in future iterations.
