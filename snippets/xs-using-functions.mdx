# Using Functions

Functions in XanoScript are designed to be as close to second nature as possible for someone who is already familiar with building in the function stack. We've designed the function names and options to ensure as much parity with the visual builder as possible.

Functions will typically begin with a **namespace** — basically, a category that the function is a part of. Each namespace is separated with a period.

As an example, the namespace below is what's used for database operations — `db`.

```
db.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Sometimes, functions will use multiple namespaces, such as `cloud.aws.opensearch`. This is infrequent though — you will usually only find yourself using a single namespace.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

After the namespace, we'd use the function name, such as:

```
db.get
```

This is the XanoScript command for [Get Record](../../the-function-stack/functions/database-requests/get-record.md). From here, things get a little more specific depending on the function you are using. For example, `db.get` is immediately followed by the name of the table we're querying.

```
db.get user
```

After we've defined our function, we can start providing the parameters that function requires, if any. Parameters are wrapped in {} characters. **Get Record** asks for a field\_name and a field\_value. Parameters do not require any quotation marks or other special characters for the parameter name, but may require them for the value depending on the data type (for example, `"hello"` vs `123`.

    field_name = "id"
    field_value = 1
    }
</code></pre> |

Finally, if the function outputs to a variable, we'll establish that **outside** of the parameter object.

```javascript
    db.get user {
      field_name = "id"
      field_value = 1
    } as user1
```
