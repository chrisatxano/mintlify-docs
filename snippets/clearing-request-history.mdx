title: clearing request history
---

From this panel, we have two options: **database storage** and **cache storage**.

## Database Storage for Request History

This is the actual database table that contains all of your request history, and counts against your available database storage in your instance. You can click on this option to delete one portion or all of your request history at any time.

Use the **Force** option to halt any running processes to ensure the data can be cleared -- please note however that this may result in a little bit of downtime as the server halts running processes.

## Cache Storage for Request History

As requests are logged, they are not immediately saved to the database. For a short period of time, they are held in a cache, and dumped into the database at fast, regular intervals. In some cases, such as during excessive traffic spikes, you may find that clearing the request cache before the items are added to the database can help the recovery process.

Please note that when items are cleared from the cache, they will not be logged in the history database.
