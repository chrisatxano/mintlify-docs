title: Switch or Conditional?

# Conditional vs Switch â€” which one should you use?

When deciding between using an If/Then statement and a Switch statement, it's important to consider the complexity and clarity of the logic you're implementing. An If/Then statement is ideal for situations where you have several conditions that require different actions. It provides straightforward logic for evaluating true or false scenarios.

On the other hand, a Switch statement is better suited for cases with multiple possible values for a single variable. It makes your function stacks cleaner and more organized by avoiding deep nesting of conditions when the logic involves fixed values. Use If/Then for more advanced conditions and Switch for handling multiple specific scenarios with more concise readability.
