title: Definition of an API
---

APIs allow different applications to communicate and share data with each other. When you use Google Maps inside another app, that's an API at work. When you click a Buy Now button on Amazon, APIs are firing at all cylinders behind the scenes.

APIs don't have to only be based on user action, either. For example, most websites implement some sort of tracking to ensure that the user experience is as smooth as possible. When you visit these websites, there are API calls being made as you navigate through their frontend.

APIs set the rules for how different pieces of software can talk to each other, making it possible for developers to integrate various services without starting from scratch.

An API has a few main components.

## Headers&#x20;

Headers are the configuration that rides along with an API request. They contain information like where the request is coming from and what type of data it contains.

## Method

The method, also known as the verb, is assigned to an API to typically dictate the type of operation the API is designed to complete.

* **GET**
  * Retrieve data
* **POST**
  * Send data
* **PUT / PATCH**
  * Update data
* **DELETE**
  * Delete data

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that when you build APIs in Xano, you can choose the method to apply, giving you full flexibility in exactly what function that API serves. While it isn't always best practice, a DELETE endpoint could technically do nothing but add new data, if it makes sense for your use case.

{% endstep %}

## Query parameters / Request body

Query parameters and the request body are kind of the same thing, but sent in an API request in different ways.

* **Query parameters** live as part of the request URL. If the API URL is `https://myapi.com/getThings` and expects you to send a thingId with your request, you would append it to the URL with `?thingId=99`, so your full request URL would be `https://myapi.com/getThings?thingId=99.` You would typically use query parameters for GET and DELETE endpoints.
* **Request Body** is like a set of query parameters, but sent as a JSON object. It's more flexible when sending complex data types, such as lists, nested objects, or files.

In the Xano visual builder, these are known as **inputs**. You can add inputs manually, or add a **Database Link** input to automatically populate and sync all fields from a database table.

## Response

The response is whatever the API sends back once it has completed the logic it is meant to perform. An API doesn't necessarily need to deliver a response, but it is typical.

Think of your frontend sending an API request when a user logs in. That API request would probably return information about the user logging in, such as their name, location, or other relevant user data.

A response has a few different pieces, similar to what's included in the request, including **response headers** and a **response body**.
