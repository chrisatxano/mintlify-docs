## Customizing the return

Click ![](<../assets/CleanShot 2025-01-06 at 14.45.09.png>) to edit the fields returned in the query.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that customizing to reduce the fields returned will not have an impact on query speed, but may help with other performance issues in your function stacks. It is always good practice to only return the fields necessary.
{% endhint %}

## Return As

Change the variable name that this function will output to.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're using conditional steps, you can use the same variable name in multiple steps to make satisfying the conditional or outputting data in the response easier.

For example, if we are sending a specific response based on if a variable is true or false, we can set both of those outputs to the same variable, making building our response easier.
{% endhint %}
