# 'Conditional'

Conditional statements are used to determine what functions to run based on the outcome of an expression, or a set of expressions.

**Hint**

For simple comparisons with multiple options, consider using [[Switch](switch.mdx) instead.

### Add a Conditional step to your function stack.


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click <mark style="color:blue;">Add Condition</mark> to add a condition.

You can add multiple conditions to a single function stack if you want to check multiple values.

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/expression-builder.md" %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Once you have your conditions defined, add additional functions into your Then and Else blocks.

If the condition(s) evaluate as **true**, it will run the steps in the Then block.

If the condition(s) evaluate as **false**, it will run the steps in the Else block.

You can also leave either of these blocks empty if you only want to utilize one of them.

### You can Use Else If to define multiple paths in the same conditional statement.

Click ![[](<../../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-07 at 16.17.46.png>)to add an Else If path to your conditional statement. The process for defining the condition(s) it checks is exactly the same as before.
