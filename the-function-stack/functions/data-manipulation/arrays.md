# Arrays

An array, or list, may contain a single item or many items. Arrays behave differently than other data types; you will typically iterate through them to transform data. These iterations can be performed with loops, or you can perform more wide-sweeping changes using [expressions](broken-reference).

We have several array functions that you can use to extract and manipulate the array quickly.

Before you dive in, let's review a key concept specific to arrays: index

The **index** is the number that corresponds to the item in the list, starting at 0. You won't see this reflected in your data, but it's how arrays keep track of their defined order of items.

## Add to End of Array

Adds an item to the end of an array

## Add to Beginning of Array

Adds an item to the beginning of an array

## Remove from End of Array

Removes the item at the end of the array

## Remove from Beginning of Array

Removes the item at the beginning of the array

## Merge

Merges two arrays together

## Find First Element

Uses the expression builder to find the first matched element of an array

## Find First Element Index

Uses the expression builder to find the index of the first matched element of an array

## Has Any Element

Returns a true or false based on if the array has any elements that meet the conditions outlined in the expression builder

## Has Every Element

Returns a true or false based on if the array has **all** elements that meet the conditions outlined in the expression builder

## Find All Elements

Uses the expression builder to find all matching elements in the array

## Get Element Count

Uses the expression builder to find the count of all matching elements in the array
