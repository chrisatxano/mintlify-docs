# 'Bulk Operations'

## Bulk Operations

Using bulk operations in Xano is largely the same between operation types. Each function expects an array of data or a custom query that it will use to apply the bulk operation, with the exception of Clear All Records.

The available bulk operations are:

* **Bulk Add Records**
* **Bulk Delete Records**
* **Bulk Patch Records**
* **Bulk Update Records**
* **Clear App Records**

For **Bulk Add Records, Bulk Patch Records, and Bulk Update Records**, you'll need to provide an array of items to add or update in the table.

**Bulk Add** and **Bulk Update** require the entire contents of the record. Make sure to include the record IDs in Bulk Update.

**Bulk Patch** only requires each object to have the ID and the fields you want updated.

For operations like **Bulk Delete**, use the custom query expression to determine which records to delete.

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/expression-builder.md" %}

## Clear All Records

Clear All Records will delete every record in the table.
