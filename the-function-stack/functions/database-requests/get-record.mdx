Get Record allows you to retrieve a single record from a database table using a single field to search by.

In Get Record, you'll provide the name of the field to search inside of, and the value to search for. These can come from inputs, variables, or you can manually specify a value.

**field\_name** is the name of the field to look inside of. For example, if we wanted to search for a record with a specific ID, we'd type `id` here.

**field\_value** is the value to search for in the provided field. Assuming we are searching in the `id` field, we would put the ID to search for here.

<Info>

If you need to find a record based on multiple fields, use [[Query All Records](query-all-records/) instead.
