# Get Database Schema

You can use the Get Database Schema function to retrieve all of the schema in JSON format for a particular table.

You can use the Path option to only get a specific field from the database if you don't need the entire table delivered.

This function is great for scenarios where you need your APIs to react based on a table's schema, or you need to provide option lists (an enum field) to a front-end connection.
