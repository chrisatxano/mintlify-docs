# Add or Edit Record

Add or Edit Record takes the best of both Add and Edit Record, and combines them into one function. Using this will...

* Edit the record if the record is found
* Add it if it isn't

Functionally, it is the same as using Edit Record.

You need to tell Xano which record you want to edit by providing a field\_name and field\_value. `Field_name` is the name of the database field to look inside of, and `field_value` is the value to look for in that field â€” for example, `field_name: id` & `field_value: 1`
