{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Head to the database

Click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-14 at 12.19.51.png>)in the left hand menu.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add a new table

Click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-14 at 12.20.52.png>)in the top right corner.

Choose **Import Data** to [[import data from a CSV file](../migrating-your-data/csv-import-and-export.mdx), or **Enter Data Manually** to start with an empty table where you can add your own data later, or generate sample data automatically.

<Success>

&#x20;If you're just starting out, we'd recommend choosing **Enter Data Manually** and using the sample data generator. You can always import data later.

</Success>

In the panel that opens, give your table a name[^1] and a description[^2]
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Give your table a name and a description.

&#x20;When naming your table, it's considered best practice to use camelCase for multiple words, and to not use plurals in the table name. For example, a table of dog breeds would be named `dogBreed`

The description is just for you to make notes on what this table will contain, notable data constraints, or any other information you'd like to store.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Choose your primary key type.

The primary key is the ID of each record. Xano offers two types of primary keys to choose from.

<Info>

## When should you use Sequential, and when should you use UUID?

When designing your database structure in Xano, choosing the right identifier type is an important decision. Here's a straightforward guide to help you decide:

**Sequential IDs are best for:**

* Performance-sensitive operations - they're faster to index and query
* Human-friendly references - easier to communicate ("Please check record #42")
* Storage efficiency - they consume less space in your database
* When chronological order matters - the sequence reveals creation order
* Single-database applications where centralized ID generation works well
* Systems that benefit from predictable numbering patterns

**Common use cases:** Customer IDs, order numbers, ticket systems, invoice numbers, internal record tracking

**UUIDs are best for:**

* Distributed systems where multiple services create records independently
* Data synchronization across different databases or systems
* Preventing ID guessing or enumeration attacks
* Frontend-first workflows where IDs need to be generated before server contact
* Multi-region deployments with separate databases
* When you don't want to expose information about record counts
* Scenarios where data privacy is paramount

**Common use cases:** User accounts in modern applications, cross-system record tracking, session management, event logging in distributed architectures

</Info>

<details>

<summary>Sequential (1, 2, 3...)</summary>

A sequential identifier is just a sequence of whole numbers (1, 2, 3, etc...).

Think of sequential IDs like numbered tickets at a deli counter. They start at 1 and count up one by one (2, 3, 4...). Just like how the first customer gets ticket #1, the first row in your database gets ID #1. This system is straightforward but requires coordination - just as you can't have two deli counters giving out the same numbers (it would confuse customers), you need to ensure you're not creating duplicate IDs across different parts of your system.

</details>

<details>

<summary>UUID</summary>

A UUID is like the serial number on your electronics - something like "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000". It's longer and looks random, similar to how no two iPhone serial numbers are alike, even if they were made in different factories. This makes UUIDs particularly useful when you have data coming from multiple sources or need to merge databases - you don't have to worry about ID conflicts, just like how Apple doesn't need to check with Samsung about what serial numbers they're using.

Some users feel that using UUIDs is also more secure. UUIDs do provide some security benefits through obscurity - you can't easily guess other valid IDs by simply incrementing a number. If a website shows you order #1234, you might guess that order #1235 exists. But if you see order 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000, you can't easily guess other valid orders.

However, it's crucial to understand that using UUIDs is not a replacement for proper security measures. You should never rely on the difficulty of guessing IDs as your only security mechanism. Proper authentication and authorization should be in place regardless of ID type.

</details>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Add some tags.

Tags in Xano can be applied to any object (tables, APIs, functions, etc...) and are used to easily find related objects when searching your workspace.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Choose to add basic CRUD endpoints.

Xano can provide you with some standard pre-built APIs for basic operations against this table. If you choose this option, you'll also want to supply an **API Group** for those endpoints to live in. You can always choose to generate these endpoints later, too.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Confirm your choices.

Once you've confirmed all of your settings are as you want them to be, click **Add Table**.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## :heavy\_plus\_sign: Adding a new field

<Danger>

## When Working in Large Tables

Making changes to your schema, such as renaming or adding fields in a extremely large table requires significant server resources. Please contact support if you encounter any issues.

</Danger>

Click the ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-14 at 22.57.46.png>) to add a new field, and choose the [[type of field](field-types.mdx) you want to add from the panel that opens.

After you've selected your desired field type, you will be presented with a number of options. You can review each one of them and what they mean below.

<table><thead><tr><th width="199">Setting</th><th width="127" data-type="checkbox">Required?</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Name</td><td>true</td><td>The name of the field you are creating</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>false</td><td>Add additional details here</td></tr><tr><td>Data Structure</td><td>true</td><td><strong>Single</strong> - Each record will only store one value in this field. This is the more common selection.<br><strong>List</strong> - Each record can hold multiple values in this field. For example, if this was a table of authors, we might have a field that can store multiple books for each author.</td></tr><tr><td>Allow Nullable Values</td><td>false</td><td>A <code>null</code> value is similar to an empty value in that it represents "nothing is here", but it's still an actual value written to the record. Useful if you need to specifically check whether or not that field has data stored.</td></tr><tr><td>Format</td><td>false</td><td>For some field types, you can specify a format. This does not change the actual data being stored and is only used to enable easier viewing and editing for you inside of the table view.</td></tr><tr><td>Default Value</td><td>false</td><td>When adding new records, you can automatically populate a default value</td></tr></tbody></table>

<Info>

**Note**

The settings listed below only impact your API endpoints that utilize the [[database link ](#user-content-fn-7)[^7]feature. This means that it is possible to make changes that break these rules via the database table view.

</Info>

<table><thead><tr><th width="199">Setting</th><th width="127" data-type="checkbox">Required?</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Required</td><td>false</td><td>Determines whether or not this field is required when adding a record</td></tr><tr><td>Sensitive Data</td><td>false</td><td>Hide the contents of this field from certain areas, such as request history</td></tr><tr><td>Column Visibility</td><td>false</td><td><strong>Public</strong> - The field will be available as an input<br><strong>Private</strong> - This field will not appear in inputs<br><strong>Internal</strong> - Hide this field from API inputs and responses</td></tr><tr><td>Custom Rules &#x26; Filters</td><td>false</td><td>See below.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Custom Rules & Filters

For each field, you can apply various rules and filters to ensure that the data is stored in the format that you expect.

<table><thead><tr><th width="179">Filter Name</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>min</td><td>Enforces a minimum number of required characters</td></tr><tr><td>max</td><td>Enforces a maximum number of required characters</td></tr><tr><td>startsWith</td><td>Enforces a prefix</td></tr><tr><td>endsWith</td><td>Enforces a suffix</td></tr><tr><td>prevent</td><td>Blacklists phrases</td></tr><tr><td>lower</td><td>Stores the value in all lowercase</td></tr><tr><td>upper</td><td>Stores the value in all uppercase</td></tr><tr><td>alphaOk</td><td>Whitelist certain alphanumeric characters</td></tr><tr><td>digitOk</td><td>Whitelist certain numbers</td></tr><tr><td>ok</td><td>Whitelist certain characters</td></tr><tr><td>pattern</td><td>Enforce a <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-8">regex pattern</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

## :gear: Field Options

Right-click on the header of a field to access field-related settings and make adjustments to the options already detailed above, as well as some additional controls.

![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 11.48.25.png>) Rename this field

<Warning>

Please note that renaming a field should be handled with care, as it may impact any function steps that reference that field.

You can click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-02-10 at 11.18.05.png>) when viewing a database table to open **Referenced By** and view any database operations that utilize that column first to understand where changes need to be made. In the screenshot below, we know we want to update the name column, so we can use **Referenced By** to find where it's used beforehand.

![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-02-10 at 11.24.08.png>)

</Warning>

![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 11.50.54.png>) Access field settings (the options detailed earlier in this document)

![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 11.51.29.png>) Make a copy of this column

![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 11.51.51.png>) Insert a new column directly after the selected column

![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-07 at 16.44.57 (1).png>) Reorder your database fields. This does not impact how the data is returned in your function stacks.

![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 11.52.26 (1).png>) Change the data type of the column

<Danger>

Xano will attempt to convert the data in the column to the new data type, but because of potential variations between data types, and the specific data being converted, this may not always be successful. It is **always** recommended to create a new column instead.

</Danger>

![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 11.53.38.png>) Delete the column

<Danger>

Deleting a column is irreversible. Proceed with caution.

## :1234: Adding Data

### Generate Test Data using AI

After you've created your database schema[[^9](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-18 at 09.52.05.png>)

This option is located at the **bottom** of your database records â€” so, if you have no records, you should see it right at the top.

<figure><img src="../..//assets/CleanShot 2025-03-18 at 09.52.47.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The record generation will look at the name and the data type for each of your fields and try to auto-suggest what they should be filled with.

<figure><img src="../..//assets/CleanShot 2025-03-18 at 09.53.20.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can click on one of those data types to change what that field is populated with, or specific settings related to that data type.

<figure><img src="../..//assets/CleanShot 2025-03-18 at 09.54.50.png" alt="" width="365"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the bottom-right corner, you can change the number of records generated, up to 100 at a time.

When you're ready, click "Generate" and you should see your new sample data populated. You can always generate more records if you'd like.

<figure><img src="../..//assets/CleanShot 2025-03-18 at 09.56.43.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<Success>

## Hint

Want to clear out all of the sample data? There's a quick "Clear All Records" shortcut in the upper-right settings menu. **This will delete all records in the table in one swing.**

</Success>

### Adding Data Manually

Click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-18 at 09.58.40.png>)at the bottom of your existing records (if any) to add a new record.

The record will be created using any default values you've specified in the field options, and you can click on each cell to fill it in manually.

You can also click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-18 at 09.59.43.png>)to open up the card view and fil in multiple, or all fields at once when creating a new record.

[^1]: When naming your table, it's considered best practice to use camelCase for multiple words, and to not use plurals in the table name.\
    \
    For example, a table of dog breeds would be named `dogBreed`

[^2]: The description is just for you to make notes on what this table will contain, notable data constraints, or any other information you'd like to store.

[^3]: Database views are the same records in your table, but filtered and/or sorted in a certain way, or have hidden fields. Views are a great tool to use if you quickly need to review specific data, or share a table view with someone else that only contains certain information.\
    \
    :book:[[ **Learn More**](database-views.mdx)

[^4]: Schema is just a way to refer to your database fields and their data types, such as:\
    \
    `id` integer\
    `name` text

[^5]: This option will show you all of the other objects that your table is referenced in, such as APIs, functions, and more.

[^6]: Indexes are an advanced concept, but crucial to maintaining a performant database.\
    \
    :book: [[**Learn More**](../database-performance-and-maintenance/indexing.mdx)

[^7]: Database Link is an easy way to make sure your function stacks always have the most up to date inputs, with all of the right settings, taken straight from the table itself. It's great if you want to ensure complete parity between your database fields and inputs in a function stack.

[^8]: A regex pattern is an advanced topic, and in most cases is not required. It is a flexible string of characters that you can use to get incredibly specific about how you want data stored in this field.\
    \
    :book: [[**Learn More**](https://regexone.com/)

[^9]: Schema is just another way to refer to the collection of fields you've added to your database, and the type of data they expect.

[^10]: The GUID is an internal, unique identifier for this table. You will almost never have to change this, and should only do so under express direction from our support team.

[^11]: Database Triggers are operations that run based on changes that occur in that table, such as a record being added or updated.\
    \
    :book: [[**Learn More**](broken-reference)

[^12]: **Auto-complete** is used to determine what data appears in the database view when other tables reference this one.\
    \
    For example, maybe you're referencing an author table inside of a book table, and you want to see the author name when viewing the books.\
