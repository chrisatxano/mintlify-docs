# 'Database Views'

## :question: What are Database Views?

In your database, you can search, filter, and sort your records to view exactly the data you're looking for. Database Views allow you to save those settings in a view for easy access or sharing.

<Warning>

Some complex data types, like filtering by arrays, is not currently possible. If you're trying to filter something and not receiving the expected results, please reach out to support or use a [[function stack](../../the-function-stack/functions/database-requests/query-all-records/) instead.

</Warning>



[^1]: An alias is used in advanced scenarios, when you are running direct database queries or external connections to your Xano database.
