### Authentication Modes

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 21.53.31.png>) Two-factor authentication requires the authorized user to click a link in their email before accessing the share.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 21.55.20.png>) This option will allow access to anyone with the link and a password to access the share.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-12-15 at 21.56.12.png>) This option will allow anyone with the link to access the share without any additional verification.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Xano recommends using **two-factor authentication (2FA)** when sharing sensitive data.
{% endhint %}

After choosing your desired authentication option, you will be presented with a link to the share and any additional settings related to the authentication method chosen. You'll also be able to send email invites directly from inside Xano.
