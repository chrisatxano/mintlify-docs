# 'Billing'

## How does billing work in Xano?

Xano uses a **fixed price model**, meaning that you will never encounter things like overages or usage charges beyond your subscription fee.

Xano subscriptions can be purchased in monthly installments, or yearly payments at a discount.

## Upgrading, Downgrading, and Making Changes

When you make changes to your Xano plan, your subscription period restarts, and you are credited during checkout for any unused time on your current subscription.

For example, if you are currently paying $30 / month, and you add an upgrade that costs $5 / month with half of your current subscription period still remaining, your total during checkout will be $20 for the first month, and $35 on future invoices.

## What is Xano's refund policy?

For **monthly plans**, no refunds will be issued.

For **yearly plans**, refunds can be issued at the discretion of our support team within the first month, minus any already used time.
