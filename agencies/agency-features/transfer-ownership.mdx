<Info>

If you don't see your client's instance available, make sure they've accepted their [[client-invite.md](client-invite.md "mention") and purchased the suggested plan.

</Info>

This will create a **copy** of the workspace and transfer that copy to your client's instance.

You should proceed with any additional work by accessing the client's instance directly, as any further changes you make on your own copy of the workspace will not transfer.
