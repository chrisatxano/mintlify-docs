# Private Marketplace

The Private Marketplace allows you to create Private Snippets exclusively for the clients of your Agency plan.&#x20;

### Create a Private Snippet

To create a Private Snippet, navigate to the "Private" tab on the left menu and select your Agency's name. Then select "Create Snippet" in the top right corner.

![Navigate to the Private Marketplace to create a Private Snippet](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 16.04.18.png>)

Creating a Private Snippet has the same UI and experience as creating a regular, shareable [Snippet](../../xano-features/snippets.md).

You can add as many API Endpoints as you want for a Private Snippet.

![Add as many relevant API Endpoints as needed for the Snippet.](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 16.33.52.png>)

Review the included content, especially the database table and records. When a Snippet uses a database request, the associate database tables will be included. You may optionally include records along with the Snippet. **Be very careful not to share sensitive information**.

Once the Snippet is created, it will automatically be published for your clients.

### Managing the Private Marketplace

The Private Marketplace has two views from your Agency instance: Created Within Your Agency and Published Within Your Agency.

**Created Within Your Agency** shows all the Private Snippets that have been created within your Private Marketplace.

**Published Within Your Agency** shows all the Private Snippets that are available to be viewed and installed by your clients within the Private Marketplace.

#### Unpublish a Private Snippet

To unpublish Private Snippet, start on the Created Within Your Agency view and select the Snippet that you wish to manage.

![Select a Snippet to manage.](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 16.43.05.png>)

Open the menu icon in the top right and select manage.

![Open the menu icon to manage the Snippet.](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 16.43.55.png>)

#### Create Update or re-Publish a Snippet.

When creating a Private Snippet, it is automatically published. If you unpublish a Private Snippet and later decide to publish it again, you do so by selecting Create Update.

Create Update also lets you make any changes and updates to an existing Snippet.

![Create Update lets you make any changes or re-publish a Snippet.](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 16.48.06.png>)

Once you select Create Update, the same experience as Create Snippet will be shown and you can make any changes to the Snippet and select Update.

### Client Install of a Private Snippet

To install a Private Snippet into a Client's Workspace, go to the Client's Instance and then select the desired Workspace to install it to.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Agency who manages the Client Instance or the Client can perform this action.
{% endhint %}

Navigate to the Private tab on the left side and select the Published Within Agency tab.

![See the Snippets published by the Agency from the Client's workspace.](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 17.07.58.png>)

Click on a Snippet you wish to install. You will first be prompted to "Get" the Snippet, which adds the Snippet Instance-wide. Once that action is performed, the Get button change to Install and it can be installed on the individual workspace.&#x20;

Other workspaces on the Instance would be required to Install the Snippet in order to add it.

### Secure Share

Secure Share enables you to require a security token for the Snippet to be viewed externally.&#x20;

Each token is only valid for a single installation. If you are going to share with multiple individuals, make sure to generate a unique link for each individual.

In order to securely share a Snippet, navigate to the Private Marketplace and select a Snippet from the Created Within Your Agency tab.

In the top right corner, select Secure Share.

![Secure Share a Snippet.](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 17.23.15.png>)

Select Generate to generate a security token.

![Generate a Security Token.](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 17.25.15.png>)

Once generated, a one-time use link will be generated with a unique security token. This link is good for a one-time use. You can copy it and send it securely for someone to use it once.

![A one-time use link will be generated to share.](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2022-03-22 at 17.26.41.png>)

The landing page for a Secure Share and installation will be the same as a regular [Snippet](../../xano-features/snippets.md).
