# 'Test Suites'

Workflow Testing allows you to create sets of different tests to validate user flows are working as expected.

## What is Workflow Testing? <a href="#what-is-workflow-testing" id="what-is-workflow-testing"></a>

Workflow Testing in Xano allows you to quickly build sets of tests that you can use to make sure a specific flow is working as expected. You can think of a 'flow' as a set of separate actions, such as multiple APIs that a user might hit when utilizing your application, or data processing across multiple function stacks.

Workflow Testing allows you to validate these sets or flows with a single click and get instant visibility into your backend functionality.

## How do I build workflow tests? <a href="#how-do-i-build-workflow-tests" id="how-do-i-build-workflow-tests"></a>

From the left-hand navigation menu, choose **Library** > **Workflow Tests** ![[](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252FkzjkcirGezN3F7HXGLol%252FCleanShot%25202024-11-21%2520at%252010.05.53.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D5d69d39c-4c57-441a-b566-1d0130d725fd\&width=300\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=580bfc46\&sv=2)

Choose **Add Workflow Test** in the top-right corner. In the panel that opens, you can give your test a name, description, and add tags for easy access later.

We've introduced some new functions to assist you in building your tests.

**Run Stacks**

Run stacks are functions you can add to your workflow tests to run other function stacks, such as APIs, custom functions, and middleware.

<table><thead><tr><th width="322">Function Name</th><th>Use Case</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Run API Endpoint</td><td>Sends a request to one of your API endpoints and returns the result</td></tr><tr><td>Run Addon</td><td>Runs an addon</td></tr><tr><td>Run Function</td><td>Runs a custom function and returns the result</td></tr><tr><td>Run Middleware</td><td>Runs a middleware and returns the result</td></tr><tr><td>Run Trigger</td><td>Runs a trigger and returns the result</td></tr><tr><td>Run Task</td><td>Runs a background task and returns the result</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Test Expressions

Test Expressions are functions used typically in conjunction with a Run Stack to determine if the output of a Run Stack is valid.

### Using Workflow Tests

In this example, we've built a workflow test to make sure our login flow works as expected.

![[](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252FAtO4icqQdr0Z99GPU2In%252FCleanShot%25202024-11-21%2520at%252011.35.34.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D7193d39e-1eca-40ad-80f2-ecfea92eeff9\&width=768\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=b093fc96\&sv=2)

We've added a **Run Stack** function to run our auth/login endpoint, and provided it with a username and password.

After that, our **Test Expression** checks to make sure that the login function is returning an authToken, which is what our login endpoint returns if a valid username and password is provided. When we click ![[](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252FCtCMyxNqw2XgZg1LKRdO%252FCleanShot%25202024-11-21%2520at%252011.37.53.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D78efed5c-c645-4e6a-870f-519d4eef5b85\&width=300\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=2d7160de\&sv=2) we can see that our test passes!

![[](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252Fyz3GKPAeNyWAVWVMidvR%252FCleanShot%25202024-11-21%2520at%252011.38.25.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D2645622a-4717-41ff-b66b-0c2c61ea18f5\&width=768\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=308cfa99\&sv=2)

If we modify our **Run API Endpoint** run stack to provide an invalid password, we can see that by running our test again, we get an error. This test has failed because an authToken was not returned.

From the main **Workflow Tests** page, we can run each of our tests by clicking the individual ![[](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252FoUpmTJCuZWivL1Xef6vj%252FCleanShot%25202024-11-21%2520at%252011.40.15.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Dd3a18f86-c6d7-40dd-b0be-41546795cfaa\&width=300\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=22d347a9\&sv=2)buttons, or we can click ![[](https://docs.xano.com/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F3176331816-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252F-M8Si5XvG2QHSLi9JcVY%252Fuploads%252F88Llfh1J3bxE448maCnq%252FCleanShot%25202024-11-21%2520at%252011.40.32.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D53e80427-90bd-4724-8c8e-bc7e1bb47ed2\&width=300\&dpr=4\&quality=100\&sign=3982857a\&sv=2)to run all of our workflow tests at once.

We can see by running all of our workflow tests the following information:

* We have **38% coverage**. This means that out of all of the function stacks that exist across our backend, 3/8 of them are used in our tests.
* We have **50% success**. This means that out of all of our workflow tests, half of them are successful.
* To run all of our tests takes less than a second.
