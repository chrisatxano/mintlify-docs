# 'Where should I start?'

## I'm completely new to software development

That's okay! You've made the right choice by coming to Xano. We pride ourselves on providing a holistic development experience without you feeling like you're underwater.

Just click the links in each step to head that direction and get started.

### Start by learning some [[key concepts](key-concepts.mdx).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### After that, make sure you've [[set up your Xano account.](set-up-a-free-xano-account.mdx)

This is a great time to learn more about the [[Software Development Life Cycle](the-development-life-cycle.mdx), but it's not required to get going.
