# Using These Docs

Throughout this documentation, we will be focusing on building a complete backend as an example. As you progress, you'll be able to follow along and build with us.

Before you dive in, let's check out some of the ways you'll learn about Xano using these docs.

### Text Content

The bread and butter of our documentation; we have a ton of content here for you to read and follow along with in product.

### Quick Summary / Definitions

### Videos

A majority of our functions, features, and use cases have accompanying video content which you can review right alongside our documentation, or save for later viewing.

### Interactive Demos

We've included interactive demos that allow you to get a feel for the experience you're reading about without leaving the documentation at all. Try the one above to see how it works!

### Actions

If you see this image anywhere, that means there is a Xano Action available for that piece of documentation. For example, if we are walking you through how to build a multi-step function, we might provide an Action alongside it that you can review, interact with, and even import into your Xano account to use right away.

### Build Along Examples

<details>

<summary><span data-gb-custom-inline data-tag="emoji" data-code="1f4da">ðŸ“š</span> <strong>Build-along Example: Online Bookstore</strong></summary>

Nice job! Look out for these in the documentation so you can build along with us!

</details>

If you see the above in any piece of our documentation, it means that there is another opportunity for you to try out that function or feature yourself by building or iterating on the Online Bookstore example. Just click the > icon to expand the content.

It's recommended that you create a new workspace to contain this sample project if you'd like to follow along. Check out the interactive demo below to see how to create a new workspace. For users on our free plan, you can use your existing workspace.

### Annotations

Every now and then, we might mention a term that, if you're following the documentation in order, you might not have heard yet. We don't want to take a hard left turn and bring you to a full lesson yet, but you can click on any term that [<mark style="color:blue;">looks like this</mark>](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] to get a quick bit of more information or context.



[^1]: Great job! This is what you'll see when clicking these terms throughout the documentation.
