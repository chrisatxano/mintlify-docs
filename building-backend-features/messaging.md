## Hint

If you haven't already, we recommend becoming familiar with these basic concepts before continuing.

## Use a Pre-built Action

Xano Actions are available for you to import directly into your workspace and enable messaging features, such as sending Slack messages.

Click on any of the Actions below to try it out and add it to your workspace.

## Build Your Own

You can also build your own messaging functions by using our [External API Request](../the-function-stack/functions/apis-and-lambdas/external-api-request.md) function and following the API documentation available for your service of choice. Some popular options are linked below for your convenience.
