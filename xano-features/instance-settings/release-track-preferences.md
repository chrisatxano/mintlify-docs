# Release Track Preferences

{% hint style="info" %}
Release track preferences are only available on our paid plans.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that emergency patches or updates may override your release track preferences.
{% endhint %}

From your Instance settings panel, you have the ability to define when Xano updates are applied to that instance. This is helpful if you want to only deploy updates to a specific maintenance window that makes sense for your application, or schedule testing after an update is applied.

* Click the :gear: icon next to your instance, and choose **Release Track** from the panel that opens.\

* Choose between the available release track options, depending on your plan.
  * **Immediate (default)** will deploy new releases to your instance as soon as they are available.
  * **Flexible** allows you to specify a maintenance window for when releases are applied to your instance.
    * **Maintenance Window** allows you to choose a timeframe that the update can be applied.
    * **Preferred release days** is available as well if you want to only install updates on specific days of the week.
  * **Manual (enterprise only)** allows for full manual control of update deployment
