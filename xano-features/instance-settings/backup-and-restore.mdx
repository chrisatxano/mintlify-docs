# 'Backup and Restore'

## How do backups work in Xano?

On all of our paid plans, Xano keeps a rolling 3-day backup of your entire instance automatically, should the need arise to restore to an earlier point.

You also have the ability to take and restore backups manually.

If you are on a free plan, please note that **no backups are available**.

## Creating a Backup

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### From your [[instance selection screen](https://app.xano.com/instance?mode=master), click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-02-06 at 06.10.48.png>) next to the instance you want to create a backup of.&#x20;


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### In the panel that opens, choose Database Backup.


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click Manual Backup


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Check the option to include media storage if you'd like that to be included in your backup.

Please note that media storage should only be backed up if absolutely necessary, as it can greatly increase the size of and duration to backup / restore the instance.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-02-06 at 06.15.33.png>) to start the process.
