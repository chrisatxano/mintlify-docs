# 'Metadata API'

<Info>

The Metadata API is in beta and is subject to changes including access.

</Info>

The Metadata API (Beta) enables you to interact with your Xano workspace schema and content programmatically. The Metadata API includes a comprehensive collection of API endpoints designed to add and modify database tables, schemas, and more.

The Metadata API is also used in some cases to facilitate an integration with Xano by providing the integration partner with your Metadata API access token.

## Getting Started with the Metadata API

### Generate an Access Token

An access token is required for any request you send to the Metadata API.

<Info>

## Before you proceed

Generating an access token requires giving it specific permissions regarding what it can access. Make sure to review available scopes before proceeding.\

</Info>

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-04 at 19.15.50.png>) in the lower-left corner and choose Instances


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click :gear: next to your instance and choose Metadata API from the panel that opens
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-04 at 19.19.08.png>)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-04 at 19.19.36.png>)


{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Give your access token a name

Access tokens can have different **scopes**, or permissions, defined. Giving each access token a recognizable name is important for you to quickly recognize which access tokens are created for specific purposes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Select the expiry for your access token

By default, Xano will revoke your Metadata API access token after 7 days, which means if you need to access the API again, you would have to generate a new token.

You can choose your own expiry duration; anything from **1 hour** to **never expire**.

<Warning>

Use caution when defining extended expiry or setting tokens to never expire. Token rotation is good security practice.

You can always revoke a token at any time.

</Warning>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Define the scopes for your token

The scopes tell Xano what this token has access to. Each scope has 4 options:

**C (Create)** - Determines whether or not this token can create new data

**R (Read)** - Determines whether or not this token can read existing data

**U (Update)** - Determines whether or not this token can update existing data

**D (Delete)** - Determines whether or not this token can delete data.

<Info>

<mark style="color:green;">**Hint**</mark>

You can hover over each permission to quickly add or remove all four types of scope.

</Info>

Each scope has their own API endpoints associated with them. If you aren't sure which scopes you need for this token, use the reference below for additional information.

<table><thead><tr><th width="194">Scope</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Database</td><td>Access any of the content in your Xano database</td></tr><tr><td>Content</td><td>Access any content outside of the database or function stacks, such as branches, data sources, and realtime</td></tr><tr><td>Live Data Source</td><td>Access the data inside of your currently live data source</td></tr><tr><td>API Groups</td><td>Access API Groups and APIs</td></tr><tr><td>Functions</td><td>Access custom functions</td></tr><tr><td>Addons</td><td>Access addons</td></tr><tr><td>Task</td><td>Access background tasks</td></tr><tr><td>Files</td><td>Access file storage</td></tr><tr><td>Request History</td><td>Access request history</td></tr></tbody></table>
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Once you've set up your token, click ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-04 at 19.32.32.png>)

You will be shown your new access token. Click the ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-04 at 19.32.56.png>) button to copy it to your clipboard.

<Danger>

**You will only be shown this token once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.**

If you lose the token, you should revoke it and create a new one.

</Danger>
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Using your Access Token in Requests

The token should be sent as a header in the following format:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
```

## Revoking an Access Token

When you access the metadata API panel, you can review all of your currently issued tokens and their scopes.

By choosing a token and clicking ![[](<../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2025-03-04 at 19.34.48.png>) you can immediately revoke that token from use.

## The Account API

The Account API allows you access to various settings and information about your Xano account.

<Danger>

Please use extreme caution when sharing your Metadata API access tokens, as they can provide access to all of your Xano data.

The Metadata API is flexible regarding sending input values. You only need to send the values required to process your request. For example, if you are updating a schema and want to just update the name, then you only need to send the updated name and the other metadata of the schema will remain unchanged.&#x20;

<Success>

For partners wanting an easier way to integrate, it may be useful to start out with the Account API. This way the only prompt from the user will be to get their access token, and then you can use the Account API to get a list of the user's instances, leading to the Instance API for workspaces, tables, and APIs.
