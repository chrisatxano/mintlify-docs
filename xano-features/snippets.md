# Snippets

Snippets are an easy way to share API endpoints with the Xano community. When you share a Snippet it will be available for anyone to add to their own workspace.&#x20;

Snippets contain all components related to the API endpoint. You can edit or add to what is included in this Snippet. **No one will have access to your workspace**.

You can see Snippets that have been created by the Xano community at [xano.com/snippet](https://www.xano.com/snippet/). You can preview a Snippet in an anonymous account to try it out or add it to an existing instance.&#x20;
