# AI Database Generator

## Build a Workspace with AI

When you create a new workspace in Xano, you can either start from scratch, or use our AI copilot to build your database and basic CRUD endpoints for you.

### Provide the AI with its first instructions.

There are a few different ways you can work with the AI generator.

* **Start with a template**
  * Choose from any of the starter templates, and converse with the AI to make it your own.
* **Tell it about what you want to build.**
  * Start a conversation with the AI generator and let it know what your goals are. It can recommend database design strategies to you, and implement them for you right away.
* **Tell it exactly the database structure you have in mind**
  * This is especially useful if you are already familiar with app development, or maybe you've done the design outside of Xano already â€” just tell the AI what tables you want in plain language, and it will do the heavy lifting for you.
