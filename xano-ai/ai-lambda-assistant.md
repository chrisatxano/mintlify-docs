# AI Lambda Assistant

## What can I build with the AI Lambda Assistant?

The Lambda Assistant can be used to write complete Lambda functions to run right alongside the rest of your function stack.

Lambda functions and the AI Assistant can take full advantage of NPM packages, including even finding the ones you might need to write your desired function. Just plug in your idea and go.
