# Increasing Plan Limits

With the Launch and Scale plans, you can manually increase the limits of each feature in the plan to support the needs of your app(s) as you grow. You can adjust any of these plan limits directly in the [**Billing**](https://app.xano.com/admin/billing) section of your Xano account by clicking "Change plan".  If you have more complex needs or are part of a larger organization, you may want to look at our [Enterprise Plans](https://www.xano.com/enterprise/).

### Pricing per feature

All prices are in $USD

> \* Media storage consists of images, videos, pdfs, and file attachments. It does not consist of database records.

> \*\* Database storage uses high performance solid state drives (SSD). This storage is used only for the database schema, the metadata of each database record, and the indexes on the metadata. Any media references in the database records would be metadata only as the actual binary of this media is stored in separate media storage.

> \*\*\* Unlimited background tasks does not mean unlimited background task resources.

### Support Enhancements

Xano offers Premium Support packages that come with improved response times and a 911 escalation service that can be added to any existing paid account.  You can learn about them on our [**Help and Support**](broken-reference) page, and upgrade to any one of them in the [**Billing**](https://app.xano.com/admin/billing) section of your Xano account by clicking "Change plan".
